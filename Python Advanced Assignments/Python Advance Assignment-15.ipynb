    "Walrus Operator: This operator is used to assign and return a value in the same expression. This removes the need for initializing the variable upfront. The major benefit of this is it saves some lines of code. It is also known as The Walrus Operator due to its similarity to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.\n",

    "yield and return statements do not require parentheses to return multiple values.\n",

    "Reversed works with a dictionary. The built-in method reversed() can be used for accessing the elements in the reverse order of insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "Dict comprehensions have been modified so that the key is computed first and the value second.\n",
    "\n",
    "importlib_metadata is a new library added in the Python’s standard utility modules, that provides an API for accessing an installed package’s metadata, such as its entry points or its top-level name.\n",
    "\n",
    "f-strings now support = , to make string interpolation easy. Python 3.8 allows the use of the above-discussed assignment operator and equal sign (=) inside the f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the three-argument form of pow(), when the exponent is -1, it calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the given value\n",
